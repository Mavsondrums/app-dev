My first repository
My favorite movies are:
1. Extraction
2. Train to Busan
3. The Diary of Whimpy Kid
----------------------------
Extraction was about a black-market mercenary who has nothing to lose is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. But in the murky underworld of weapons dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.
Train to Busan was about the film mostly takes place on a KTX from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the country and threatens the safety of the passengers.
The Diary of Whimpy Kid was about in Greg which is an average American kid who struggles to fit in at school and deal with his family. He's concerned about his popularity and tries to boost it through bodybuilding, cartooning, and other schemes. However, his attempts usually backfire.
